## Build Instructions

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

Below git configuration is required:
```bash
    $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Download proprietary graphics and multimedia drivers from Renesas.

To download Multimedia and Graphics library and related Linux drivers, please use the following link:

    English: https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/rzg-linux-platform/rzg-marcketplace.html
    Japanese: https://www.renesas.com/jp/ja/products/rzg-linux-platform/rzg-marcketplace.html

Graphic drivers are required for Wayland. Multimedia drivers are optional.

After downloading the proprietary package, please put the package at $WORK then use copy script as below:

```bash
    $ tar -C $WORK -zxf $WORK/RZG2_Group_*_Software_Package_for_Linux_*.tar.gz
    $ export PKGS_DIR=$WORK/proprietary
    $ cd $WORK/meta-rzg2
    $ sh docs/sample/copyscript/copy_proprietary_softwares.sh -f $PKGS_DIR
    $ unset PKGS_DIR
```

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. e.g.:
```bash
    $ source poky/oe-init-build-env
```

Prepare default configuration files. :
```bash
    $ cp $WORK/meta-rzg2/docs/sample/conf/<board>/<toolchain>/*.conf ./conf/
```
\<board\> : ek874, hihope-rzg2m, hihope-rzg2n, hihope-rzg2h

\<toolchain\> : poky-gcc, linaro-gcc

**(Optional)** If you would like to enable Docker feature, please uncomment the below line inside file _"./conf/local.conf"_:
```
    #MACHINE_FEATURES_append = " docker"
```

**(Optional)** If you would like to use Realtime BSP, please add the below line inside file _"./conf/local.conf"_:
```
    IS_RT_BSP = "1"
```
Build the target file system image using bitbake:
```bash
    $ bitbake core-image-<target>
```
\<target\>:minimal, bsp, weston, qt, hmi

After completing the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory _'tmp/deploy/images/\<supported board name\>'_.

Images generated:
* Image (generic Linux Kernel binary image file)
* Image-\<machine name\>.dtb (DTB for target machine)
* core-image-\<target\>-\<machine name\>.tar.bz2 (rootfs tar+bzip2)
* core-image-\<target\>-\<machine name\>.ext4  (rootfs ext4 format)

## Build Instructions for SDK

Use bitbake -c populate_sdk for generating the toolchain SDK:
For 64-bit target SDK (aarch64):
```bash
    $ bitbake core-image-weston(|qt)-sdk -c populate_sdk
```
The SDK can be found in the output directory _'tmp/deploy/sdk'_

    poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-weston(|qt)-aarch64-toolchain-x.x.sh

Usage of toolchain SDK: Install the SDK to the default: _/opt/poky/x.x_
For 64-bit target SDK:
```bash
    $ sh poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-weston(|qt)-aarch64-toolchain-x.x.sh
```
For 64-bit application use environment script in _/opt/poky/x.x_
```bash
    $ source /opt/poky/x.x/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
```

## Build configs

It is possible to change some build configs as below:
* GPLv3: choose to not allow, or allow, GPLv3 packages
  * **Non-GPLv3 (default):** not allow GPLv3 license. All recipes that has GPLv3 license will be downgrade to older version that has alternative license (done by meta-gplv2). In this setting customer can ignore the risk of strict license GPLv3
  ```
  INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE = "GPLv3 GPLv3+"
  ```
  * Allow-GPLv3: allow GPLv3 license. If user is fine with strict copy-left license GPLv3, can use this setting to get newer software version.
  ```
  #INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE = "GPLv3 GPLv3+"
  ```
* CIP Core: choose the version of CIP Core to build with. CIP Core are software packages that are maintained for long term by CIP community.
  * Buster-limited: use limited packages from CIP Core Buster
  ```
  CIP_MODE = "Buster-limited"
  ```
  * **Buster-full (default)**: use as many packages from CIP Core Buster as possible (include packages in Buster-limited).  
  Note: although perl package is available for Buster-full, it is excluded at default because of its complex dependencies (especially it depends on binutils, which requires GPLv3 enabled, thus conflict with Non-GPLv3 config). As a result, perl version in poky will be used instead.
  ```
  CIP_MODE = "Buster-full"
  ```
  * Jessie: not use CIP Core Buster, use limited packages from CIP Core Jessie instead
  ```
  CIP_MODE = "Jessie"
  ```
  * None CIP Core: not use CIP Core at all, use all default version from Yocto 2.4 Rocko
  ```
  CIP_MODE = "none"
  ```
Below table show the version of recipes that change due to above setting.  
Note that this table only show packages that change version, others are not shown.  
Package versions noted with `(debian)` mean they are CIP Core packages. The source code is taken from Debian repo. Different with original version, Debian version has many bug fixes backported from newer version.

binutils is an optional package, and due to its GPLv3 license, it cannot be added to core-image with non-GPLv3 setting.
